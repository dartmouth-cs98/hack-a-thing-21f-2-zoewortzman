# ReactNative Login Screen 


## What you built?

In this assignment, we built a response login app in reqct.js using react mobile express and a MySQL database. The application that we built also stored the session data from the currently logged in user. In the application, the user types in their username and password and then clicks login. The session is then started, and the user is brought to a login screen. Just as with any other login application, if the user refreshes the page, they are still logged in, and the user also stays logged in even if they close the browser and then reopen it (for example if google chrome crashed for some reason). Finally, the user is able to log out in which case they are brought back to the login page. 

## Who Did What?

Zoe and I initially struggled with the Github repository. We had some difficulty joining the same repository, and then renaming it (which is why it is called hack-a-thing-21f-2-ZoeWortzman). Because we had problems with the repository, we worked on the tutorial together on one laptop (Zoe's) for a while at the beginning. So, we would watch the videos togther, and take turns coding on Zoe's laptop. The coding was completely a joint effort, and we would often stop the tutorial videos to go over the sections we had just watched to discuss what we had learned. We also jointly wrote this ReadMe file. 

## What you learned 

We learned a lot about the differences in coding the frontend vs. backend of an application. Both of us are relatively new to this development process, and we both understand the process a lot better. In addition, we learned how to use the Express js API which we used to build the backend of the application. Generally, we were both not super familiar with JavaScript programming prior to this project. Before we began coding the application, and sometimes during, we used a JavaScript tutorial course that we found online. This course was on CodeAcademy https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript. We found this course to be very useful and it was really helpful to refer to while we were coding the application. Additionally, Hailey had never used React Native before and used a few different websites to learn more about it (https://learn.reactnativeschool.com/courses/enrolled/253279, https://learn.reactnativeschool.com/courses/enrolled/1147788).  

Throughout our development process, we faced a few difficulties. The first was with Github, as we were unable to code on two computers at first. Maybe we are bad at Github, but we believe that we are not the only ones (which is why we need the technology that Hailey has pitched). Aside from Github, we also had a really hard time debugging our application. Although we had a good basic understanding of JavaScript from the tutorials we looked at, we still really struggled to recognize our errors as we were coding. This was definitely the aspect of our development process that took the longest amount of time as it was definitely challenging looking for errors in a language that we were not completely familiar with. In addition, we also struggled a lot with building the database of users. We had to use the php myadmin database in order to do this, and had a lot of issues with this database.
